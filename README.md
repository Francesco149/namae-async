Async-oriented rewrite of my tiny dns client.

This is a partial implementation of a DNS client that includes
the bare minimum to resolve A records from a fixed DNS server.

Only a linux platform layer is currently implemented, but
ports are very welcome and shouldn't be too hard.

The code is meant to be copypasted into projects as needed,
check out ```namae.c``` for documentation and an example
with async sockets at the bottom.

This is free and unencumbered software released into the public
domain, check out the attached ```UNLICENSE```.
